# Wine Rating
## How different features affect the rating of wine

**Joshua Nickell**:

### Business Problem:

I am going to try to create a model to predict the rating a wine will recieve.

### Data:
The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset

### Price Based on Rating

As the rating goes up, so does the price.

### Price Based on Body

A higher body wine seems to mean a higher price, possibly suggesting a higher body wine is higher quality.

## Models
I created a KNeighbors model, and a Random Forest model. The KNN model had an accuracy of 45%, and the Random Forest model had an accuracy of 49%

## Recommendations:
I would not recommend using this model for production. This dataset has alot of tweaking that needs to be done to the features to make the models better at predictions. This dataset was full of duplicate values, and may not be able to train a model properly.
