# Wine Rating
## How different features affect the rating of wine

**Joshua Nickell**:

### Business Problem:

I am going to try to create a model to predict the rating a wine will recieve.

### Data:
The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/spanish-wine-quality-dataset

### Price Based on Rating

As the rating goes up, so does the price.

### Price Based on Body

A higher body wine seems to mean a higher price, possibly suggesting a higher body wine is higher quality.

## Models
I created a KNeighbors model, and a Random Forest model. The KNN model had an accuracy of 43%. The Random

## Recommendations:
I would not recommend using this model for production. This dataset has alot of tweaking that needs to be done to the features to make the models better at predictions.
